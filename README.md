# T-cell_and_glial_pathology_in_PD
Code and data for The spatial landscape of glial pathology and adaptive immune response in Parkinson's Disease 

# Spatial cross-correlation
This is a Python module for spatial cross-correlation analyses

## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dalhoomist/T-cell_and_glial_pathology_in_PD.git
```

## Set up Environment
Requirement
```bash
Python: 3.6.13
Numpy: 1.18.5
Pandas: 1.1.5
```

You can build the environment with Anaconda(or miniconda):
```bash
$ conda create -n scc python==3.6.13
$ conda activate scc
(scc) $ cd T-cell_and_glial_pathology_in_PD
(scc) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage - sample data
- This module, in case of interruption and resumption, skips the already computed part and proceeds with the remaining.
- As the output is already stored in the sample_data folder, executing a command for sample data will cause the program to terminate immediately upon initiation.
- To observe normal operation, delete some output from the path ['sample_data/out/1'].
```bash
(scc) $ python scc.py --input sample_data/ --output sample_data/out/ --order 1 --n 10
```
Parameter
```bash
[--input]  # Directory for both the enrichment matrices and adjacency matrices.
[--output] # Directory for output
[--order]  # The order of adjacency matrices
[--n]      # The number of CPU cores.
```
* Using more CPUs does not guarantee a reduction in processing time.
 
* Increasing the number of CPUs beyond a certain point may result in diminishing returns or even performance degradation due to overhead, such as inter-process communication.

* Due to current technical limitations, the number of CPU cores is limited to the number of rows in the Enrichment matrices(`nrow`). Even if you input a number exceeding `nrow`, the command will be executed with  [--n] set to `nrow`.

## Data Format - input
- Please ensure that the order of barcode names matches for both matrices.
- Datasets are expected to be prepared in a `csv` format.
- Adjacency matrices for input should be

|  | AGTGTGGTCTATTGTG-1 | GCTATCGCGGCGCAAC-1 |  ... |Barcode n|
| :----:| :----: | :----: |  :----: | :----: | 
|AGTGTGGTCTATTGTG-1|0|1|...|0|  
|AGTGTGGTCTATTGTG-1|0|0|...|1|
|...|...|...|...|...|
|Barcode n|0|0|...|0|

- Enrichment matrices for input should be

|  | AGTGTGGTCTATTGTG-1 | GCTATCGCGGCGCAAC-1 |  ... |Barcode n|
| :----:| :----: | :----: |  :----: | :----: | 
|Type_A|0.01306|0.00010|...|0.00022|  
|Type_B|0.33542|0.48310|...|0.07694|
|...|...|...|...|...|
|Type_n|0.05631|0.06172|...|0.04630|

## Data Format - output

| combo_name | local_scc | global_scc | permutation | p_val |

|Type_Z_x_Type_Z|[-0.0661,...]|0.0075|0.0072,...]|0.37|

```bash
[combo_name]  # The pairing of two elements' names.
[local_scc]   # Local measurement of spatial cross-correlation.
[global_scc]  # Global measurement of spatial cross-correlation.
[permutation] # The outcome of conducting the permutation test one hundred times.
[p_val]       # P-value test.
```

## Data Directory - input
- Each sample should have matching names for both the enrichment matrices and adjacency matrices.
- You can set the path for the input folder, but ensure that all enrichment matrices are located within the 'enrich' folder.
- The folder containing adjacency matrices should follow the format 'adj_1', 'adj_3', etc., where the latter number indicates the order.

```bash
sample_data/
	├── enrich
    		├── Sample_A.csv
    		├── Sample_B.csv
    		└── ...
	├── adj_1
    		├── Sample_A.csv
    		├── Sample_B.csv
    		└── ...
	├── adj_2
    		├── Sample_A.csv
    		├── Sample_B.csv
    		└── ...
	└── out
```
## Data Directory - output

- Each sample's folder contains distributed computation outputs, which will eventually be concatenated and saved in the designated output path.
- In the output path, the module will automatically generate a folder named according to [--order].
```bash

  sample_data/out/
	        ├── 1 
	            ├── Sample_A_1
	                ├── Sample_A_1_0.csv
	                ├── Sample_A_1_1.csv
	                ├── Sample_A_1_2.csv
	                └── ...

	    		└── ...
		    ├── Sample_A_1.csv --> (final output for Sample_A, order=1)
	            ├── Sample_B_1.csv --> (final output for Sample_B, order=1)
	            └── Sample_C_1.csv --> (final output for Sample_C, order=1)
	        ├── 2
  		    ├── ...
		    └── ...
